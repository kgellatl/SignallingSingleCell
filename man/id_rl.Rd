\title{identify receptors and ligands}
\usage{
id_rl(input, database = "helft")
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{the input ex_sc}
}
\description{
This function will id receptors and ligands in your data and mark them in fData
}
\details{
This will use data(Receptor_Ligand_Data) to write to fData 3 columns, one for
receptors, one for ligands, and one for the expressed pairs. TRUE FALSE in the first 2 if the gene is a ligand or receptor respectively.
For all pairs where both a receptor and ligand are expressed, a 3rd column named
networks_expressed_pairs will be created with all ligands expressed that bind that receptor.
Note that this uses HUMAN GENE NAMES!!
