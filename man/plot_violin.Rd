\arguments{
\item{input}{Bioconductorâ€™s ExpressionSet Class with unlogged values in exprs().}

\item{title}{Title of the graph. Would be the gene name if not specificed.}

\item{gene}{to plot the expression level of.}

\item{color_by}{a pData variable.}

\item{log_scale}{If true, transform UMIs by log2(UMI + 1).}

\item{colors}{What colors to utilize for categorial data. Be sure it is of the proper length.}

\item{facet_by}{a vector with one or two pData variables. If two, the first variable as columns and the second as rows.}

\item{spread}{e.g. Healthy catagory is unique in Disease and Skin. To use Healthy only as skin but not Disease, that is adding Healthy skin to each disease, spread = c("Disease", "Healthy").}

\item{plot_mean}{plot the mean value as black dot with second y-axis on the right.}

\item{size}{the size of dots.}

\item{sig}{the number of digits after the decimal point for cell fraction value.}

\item{number_labels}{show the total cell numbers and cell fraction with non-zero expression values under each bar.}

\item{text_sizes}{a vector of title_size, axis_title, axis_text, legend_title, legend_text, facet_text, faults too c(20,10,5,10,5,5)}

\item{theme}{the plot theme. Default to be "classic" if not set to "bw".}

\description{
Create violin plot.
}
\details{
Utilize information stored in pData to control the plot display. Each point_by as a dot with a bar showing the weighted mean of all point_by dots.

\examples{
plot_violin(ex_sc, gene = "CXCL13", color_by = "Skin", facet_by = c("Disease", "CellType"), log_scale = T)
plot_violin(ex_sc, gene = "CXCL13", color_by = "Skin", facet_by = c("CellType", "Disease"), spread = T, log_scale = T)
